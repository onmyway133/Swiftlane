## Workflow

`Workflow` is the execution context, which groups and runs all tasks sequentially using `Sequence` task. `Workflow` handles error by printing it to the console.

You can use `Workflow` however you like, but it is designed to be used in multiple projects or a project with different build flavors. You can also have 1 `Workflow` for building related tasks, and another `Workflow` for archiving and uploading tasks. 

`Workflow` has a `name` property where you can use to identify a certain workflow.

## Working directory

By default, all tasks in workflow is related to the current executable running directory, you can change that by using `workingDirectory(_:)` modifier.

```swift
let workflow = Workflow {
    Build()
    Test()
}
    .name("My primary workflow")
    .workingDirectory(Directory.home.appendingPathComponent("XcodeProject2/Puma/Example/TestApp").path)
```

## Summarizer

Workflow has a `Summarizer` where it lists all running tasks when workflow starts, and a summarizer with running duration when workflow finishes. Here is a sample summary.

```
   1. ✅ Print working directory (0s)
   2. ✅ Wait (2s)
   3. ✅ Retry (0s)
   4. ✅ Run script (0s)
   5. ✅ Download app metadata from AppStore Connect (8s)
   6. ☑️ Set version number (0s)
   7. ✅ Show available destinations (0s)
   8. ✅ Set build number (0s)
   9. ☑️ Boot simulator (0s)
  10. ✅ Build (2s)
  11. ✅ Test (11s)
  12. ☑️ Screenshot (0s)
  13. ☑️ Archive (0s)
  14. ☑️ Export archive (0s)
  15. ☑️ Upload app to AppStore Connect (0s)
  16. ❌ Send message to Slack (0s)
```


## Logger

By default, Workflow uses `Console` logger which just prints to the console, you can configure to a `FileLogger` which saves logged content to a file of your choice. You can also customize by conforming to our `Logger` protocol

```swift
public protocol Logger {
    func log(_ string: String)
    func finalize() throws
}
```

Here is how to use `FileLogger`

```swift
let workflow = Workflow {
    Build()
    Test()
}
    .logger(FileLogger(saveFilePath: Directory.downloads.appendingPathComponent("puma.log").path))
```
