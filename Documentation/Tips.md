## Tips and tricks

Here are some tips and tricks to work with Puma more efficiently

## Environment variables

When Puma is run as a macOS command line library, you can access environment variables via `ProcessInfo`

```swift
UploadApp(path: Directory.downloads.appendingPathComponent("TestApp.ipa").path)
    .username(ProcessInfo().environment["username"]!)
    .password(ProcessInfo().environment["password"]!)
```

If you set environment variables in scheme in Xcode, you can choose to have 2 scheme, one shared main scheme and 1 unshared but with environment variables.

## Directory

Puma encourages explicity, so you have to provide explicit paths. Instead of typing path like `/Users/khoa/Downloads`,you can use the `Directory` class which provides nifty properties for popular locations, they are file `URL` so you can append path component further.

```swift
Directory.home
Directory.downloads
Directory.applications
```

## Configure tasks directly

Some tasks like Build, Test, UploadApp uses command line tools like xcodebuild or altool, and they provide convenient configuration methods

```swift
Build()
    .workspace("TestApp")
    .scheme("TestApp")
```

In case you want to customize, you can configure on the command line tool directly

```swift
Build()
    .arguments("--scheme", "TestApp")
```
